# Real_Time_Operating_Sytem
An STM32 FreeRTOS project for the RT-Spark board demonstrating multitasking, LCD display control, sensor reading, PWM-based RGB LED control, and mutex-protected shared resources using Embedded C.

This repository contains the main application code for an STM32 FreeRTOS project.
Inside this folder/repository, you will also find the LCD driver files, which are used to interface with the onboard LCD display (ST7789 via FSMC). These drivers handle LCD initialization, drawing functions, and text rendering required by the application.
